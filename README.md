# ML_Model-for-Medical-Charges-Prediction
In this project, the primary objective was to develop a predictive model for estimating medical costs based on the health conditions of individuals. Leveraging the linear regression algorithm, the dataset, comprised of diverse medical cost information, was systematically trained to formulate accurate predictions.
